This is a personal project with a simple register and login system where a user can store their thoughts. 
They will also get to see another user's thought at random when they refresh the page.

It features jQuery which binds the onchange to a textarea where the user can type their thoughts and uses AJAX to call a PHP
script that automatically updates the database as the user is changing the text area.
